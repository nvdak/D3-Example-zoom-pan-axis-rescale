This is a mashup of the D3 *Spline* and *Zoom + Pan* examples along with [Ricardo's example of X axis re-scaling by dragging](http://bl.ocks.org/1179647). 

There are still some problems however ...

* Drag on the canvas to translate the graph.
* double-click on the canvas to zoom in
* shift-double-click on the canvas to zoom out
* Drag on the X axis text to rescsale the X axis
