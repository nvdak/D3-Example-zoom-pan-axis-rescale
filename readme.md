[This example](http://bl.ocks.org/1182434) is a mashup of the [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) **Spline** and **Zoom-Pan** examples along with [Ricardo Marimon's example of X-axis re-scaling by dragging](http://bl.ocks.org/1179647).

* double-click on the canvas to zoom in
* shift-double-click on the canvas to zoom out
* Drag on one of the X or Y axis numeric labels to re-scale that axis
* click on a data point to select it
* drag a selected data point to change it's value
* enter the delete or backspace key to delete a selected data point
